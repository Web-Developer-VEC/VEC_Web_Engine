          "Civil Engineering, the Mother of all Engineering Disciplines, its Sons and Daughters, the Young Civil Engineers are the Nation Builders for sustaining Civilization anywhere in the World and Universe.Starting from 2007, Department of Civil Engineering joined in contributing towards nation building through our Graduate Civil Engineers.","The B.E. Civil Engineering program of VEC is continuously accredited by NBA since 2015. So far 32 graduates from the Department have been placed in State and Central Government jobs (IRS, IOCL, Revenue, Police, PWD, Highways, Water Resources, Buildings, CMDA, Local Administration...) and also in many other countries like UK, USA, Canada, Singapore, Dubai, Australia, etc. in various roles and positions.","To achieve this, the Department is equipped with sophisticated laboratories and field oriented teaching and training. About 85% of students are placed in Core & IT companies (45+ Core Companies & 20+ IT companies). Around 200+ Students opted for higher studies in India & Foreign Universities through GATE, GRE & GMAT. Currently under Autonomous mode, the curriculum is further enriched to facilitate student community to reach greater heights and zeniths."
