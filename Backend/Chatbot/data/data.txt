REQUIREMENTS FOR APPEARING FOR SEMESTER END  EXAMINATIONS  A candidate shall normally be permitted to appear for the semester  end  Examinations for all the courses registered in the current semes ter (vide clause 6)  if he/she satisfies the semester completion requirements (subject to Clause 7).   A candidate who has already appeared for any subject in a semester and passed  the examination is not entitled to reappear in the same subject for improvement of  grades.  14. PASSING REQUIREMENTS   14.1 A candidate who secures not less than 50% of the total marks prescribed for the  course [Internal Assessment + Semester End Examinations] with  a minimum of  45% of the marks prescribed for the semester end Examination, shall be declared  to have passed the course and acquired the relevant number of credits. This is  applicable for both theory and practical courses (including project work).   14.2 If a student fails to secure a pass in a theory course / practical course (except  electives), the student shall register and appear only for the semester end  examination in the subsequent semester (s). In such case, the internal assessment  marks obtained by t he student in the first appearance shall be retained and  considered valid for all subsequent attempts till the student secures a pass.   However, from the third attempt onwards if a student fails to obtain pass marks  (Internal Assessment + Semester End Exami nation), then the student shall be  declared to have passed the examination if he/she secures a minimum of 50%  marks prescribed for the Semester End Examinations alone.   14.3 If the course, in which the student has failed, is a Professional Elective or an  Open Elective course, the student may be permitted to complete the same course   in the subsequent semester(s) . In such case, the internal assessment marks  obtained by the student in the first appearance shall be retained and considered  valid for all subseque nt attempts till the candidate secures a pass. However, from  the third attempt onwards if a candidate fails to obtain pass marks ( Internal  Assessment + Semester End Examinations) as per clause 14.1, then the candidate shall be declared to have passed the e xamination if he/she secures a minimum of  50% marks prescribed for the Semester End Examinations alone.   If any other Professional Elective or Open Elective course is opted by the student,  the previous registration is cancelled and henceforth it is to be co nsidered as a  new Professional Elective or Open Elective course. The student has to register  and attend the classes, earn the continuous assessment marks, fulfill the  attendance requirements as per clause 7 and appear for the Semester End  Examinations.  14.4 If a student is absent during the viva - voce examination of the project work, it will  be considered as fail.  14.5 The passing requirement  for the courses which are assessed only through internal   assessments (Internship / Technical seminar, etc), is 50% of the internal assessment  (continuous assessment) marks.  14.6 A student can apply for revaluation of the student’s semester end examination  answer paper in a theory course, within 2 weeks from the declaration of results, on   payment of a prescribed fee along with t h e prescribed application to the COE  through the Head of the Department.

Revaluation is not permitted for practical course and project work.  14.7 The passing requirement for NCC Credit courses shall be 50% of the marks  prescribed for the co urse (Internal assessment only). The grades O, A+, A, B+, B  and C obtained shall figure in the Mark sheet under the title ‘ NCC Credit Courses’.  The other grades U, SA will not figure in the mark sheet. The credits earned  through NCC Credit courses shall not be considered for calculating GPA and  CGPA. The credits earned through NCC credit courses shall not be considere d for  classification of degree. If the course is offered during any semester, it will appear  in that semester's mark sheet.  14.8  ASSESSMENT FOR MANDATORY COURSES            For all mandatory courses (except Induction program and Personality and  character development) C ontinuous internal evaluation and Semester end  examination will be similar to theory examination as per clause vide 12.   Mandatory 2 -week long induction program WITHOUT ASSESSMENT will be  conducted for the UG students admitted in  the institution. Normal cla sses start  only after the induction program . Its purpose is to make the students feel  comfortable in their new environment, open them up, set a healthy daily routine,  create bonding in the batch as well as between faculty and students, develop  awareness, s ensitivity and understanding of the self, people around them, society  at large, and nature .    15. AWARD OF LETTER GRADES   The award of letter grades for theory courses will be decided based on relative  grading principle. The relative grading is applicable to ONLY those students who have passed the examination as per the passing requirements enumerated above.   For those students who have passed the theory course, the relative grading shall  be done. The marks of those students who have passed only shall be giv en as  input into the software developed for relative grading. The evolved relative  grading method normalizes the results data using the BOX -COX transformation  method and computes the grade range for each course separately and awards the  grade to each stude nt.    For a given theory course, if the students’ strength is greater than 30, the relative  grading method shall be adopted.

The relative grading is applicable to ONLY those learners who have passed the  examination as per the passing requirements enumerated above. For those Learners who have  passed the theory course, the relative grading shall be done. The marks of those Learners who  have passed only shall be given as input into the software developed for relative grading. The  evolved relative grading method normalizes the results data using the BOX -COX  transformation method and computes the grade range for each course separately and awards  the grade to each Learner. For a given theory course, if the Learners’ strength is greater than  30, the relative grading method shall be adopted. However, if the Learners’ strength is less  than 30 then the fixed grading shall be followed with the grade range as specified below.    O A+ A B+ B C U  91-100 81-90 71-80 61-70 56-60 50-55 <50    Fixed grading shall be followed with the grade range as specified below for award of  grades for online NPTEL courses    O A+ A B+ B C U  90-100 80-89 70-79 60-69 50-59 40-49 <40    For Practical courses and project work absolute grading method is to be followed  as  specified in the table above.  The performance of a Learner shall be reported using letter grades, each carrying certain  points as detailed below: 26 | P a g e                       Letter Grade Grade Points*  O (Outstanding) 10  A+ (Excellent) 9  A (Very Good) 8  B+ (Good) 7  B (Average) 6  C (Satisfactory) 5  U (Re-appearance) 0  SA (Shortage of Attendance) 0  W(Withdrawal) 0                A student is deemed to have passed and acquired the corresponding credits in a particular  course if he/she obtains any one of the following grades: “O”, “A+”, “A”, “B+”, “B”,”C”.   ‘SA’ denotes shortage of attendance (as per clause 10.3) and hence prevention from writing  the end semester examinations. ‘SA’ will appear only in the result sheet.   “RA” denotes that the student has failed to pass in that course. “W” denotes withdrawal from  the examination of the course. The grades RA and W will figure both in Grade Sheet as well  as in Result Sheet. In both cases, the student must appear for the End Semester Examinations  as per the Regulations. If the grade RA is given to Theory Courses/ Laboratory Courses it is  not required to satisfy the attendance requirements (vide clause 10), but must appear for the  end semester examination and fulfil the norms specified in clause 12 to earn a pass in the  respective courses. If the grade RA is given to Project work, the course must be registered  again and attendance requirement (vide clause 10) should be satisfied.   If the grade RA is given to EEC course (except project work), which are evaluated only  through internal assessment, the student shall register for the course again in the subse quent  semester fulfill the norms as specified in Clause 13 to earn pass in the course. However,  attendance requirement need not be satisfied.
